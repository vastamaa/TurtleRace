# <div id="top">TurtleRace</div>

This project was a hobby project. I wanted to make a simple program when we started out programming in python to get more familiar with it.

## Description

When you start the program, four turtles will be created, and they will race till the finish line with random 'speed' values. After the race, they will be sorted by their time. The names, colors are randomly generated from the four name and color literals within the program code. It's kind of like a Turtle Derby.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 10
* Visual Studio Code
* Extension(s) in Visual Studio: Python

### Installing
